                            My name is Pavaris Kakanat. As a Thai, it is customary that 
                            everyone has a nickname and I am no exception so my friends and 
                            family call me “Bomb”. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand but I was
                            raised in a town located in South Thailand called "Nakhon Si Thammarat".
                             I lived there for the first 13 years of my life and moved to New Zealand 
                            in late 2008. It was one of the most fun AND scary experiences in 
                            my life. It was fun because it was a journey to a completely new 
                            country where everything was different, especially the culture and 
                            the food. Now about the scary part. I found it very intimidating 
                            when I was moving over here because I did not know how to verbally 
                            communicate in English. I only knew a few words and how to read 
                            simple sentences. I cannot say that it was an easy journey but I 
                            can say it was very fun. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My past job experiences have mostly been in various Customer Service
                            roles. I have also worked as an Inventory Controller Team member in 
                            a wine production and storage warehouse. The most prideful yet short 
                            lived career I have had was as a Flight instructor but due to the 
                            global pandemic, the industry took a major hit and will take some time 
                            to recover. This means that the pilots will be losing flying jobs 
                            until further notice. However, I am glad that I have found coding. 
                            Learning to code has been loads of fun so far barring the stress 
                            induced, hair pulling moments when I cannot figure something out. 
                            However, I am hoping that once I look back on all of this, it will 
                            make a beautiful journey full of fun.
