      <p class="tab"> To capture who I am as a person, I would have to start off with Buddhism. Buddhism is my religion and a little bit about Buddhism if you have never heard of it before,
        it is a teaching about peace and how to achieve it then apply it to everyday in your daily lives. I personally don’t like to call it a religion, because to me Buddhism
        is teaching a way of life rather than a belief system which has to deal with god. You see, there is no god in Buddhism. Buddha wasn’t the one to create the circle of 
        life, he was merely living through it and trying to understand it himself. The difference between Buddha and all Buddhist is the mere fact that he is our teacher that 
        has found a solution while working at it hands on and that we are his students, trying to follow his footstep on the path to peace and to detach yourself from the circle
        of life. The teaching’s sole focus is on understanding the matter and yet letting it go. When I am saying letting go, I am talking about letting go of everything and
        anything unexpected that may come up. Or letting go of anything undesirable that has been on your mind. If you think of a person’s brain as a computer, the more the 
        person has on their mind (almost like running multiple tabs and tasks on your computer) this will limit that person’s capability to process information and the mental 
        capacity (computing power). So if you can let go (closing tabs after you’ve processed it) it will help you become the best version of yourself. It is mind training meant 
        to deal with life and help you cope with uncertainties in life. Part of Buddhism is accepting death as a normal part of life. The way I see it is you have to understand 
        that we’re here on borrowed time, we don’t know how long we have exactly before that borrowed time runs dry.

       I am a firm believer that to know who a person really is you have to know what is important to them. For me my number one priority is my family.
       My family will always come first because they are the one that have seen me at the lowest and yet will still support me on my decisions especially if those decisions 
       will lead to a better version of me. I know that there are people out there who care for me and wish the best for me that aren’t technically my blood relatives(family) 
       but I consider those as my own and treat them like family. Because I think it is very difficult nowadays to meet people that are genuine to you and genuinely want the 
       best for you, so I will cherish those that I have found and will hold them close to my heart, as I would with family. To give an example: A few years ago, I was living 
       in Blenheim, working as an Inventory controller for a wine bottling company. I was in a comfortable job/pay. And came along the day I was on the phone talking to my 
       parents(who were at the time living in Tokoroa) and found out that the shop that my mum ran got stolen from and that my mum was also feeling threatened and is scared 
       to go to open up and close down by herself. As soon as I found out about that, I knew that I had to be there for my mum and at least go help her out until things 
       settle down. So the following day I quit my job, and let them know the situation and that I urgently needed to go to Tokoroa. Then as soon as I could I was up in 
       Tokoroa to make sure my mum feels safe and when I had the chance I talked to some of the local policemen in Tokoroa that were customers at our shop and let them know 
       the situation, they were more than happy to help keep an eye on her when she closes late and ever since then. It is a nightly routine that a cop car would drive down 
       the street every few hours to see if she has finished up and has already gone home. As for the stolen items, they weren’t just drinks so we just had to take the L on 
       that but the good thing that came of it and the main thing is that my mum is safe and worry free.

        I believe my biggest strength is the ability to learn and adapt quickly. 
        I have had to adapt to changes quite a lot in my life. The idea that life 
        s ever changing is implanted within me from a very young age. Through 
        Buddhism I have learned about the impermanence and therefore I accept 
        changes, even challenging ones, with relative ease. There were many 
        things that kept changing, my schools, my uniform to as far as languages 
        to what is considered a normal lunch. It’s almost safe to say that the 
        ‘constant’ I had growing up is ‘change’. I’m thankful for what happened 
        because it made me good at adapting to changes from a very young age and 
        prepared myself for what was yet to be thrown at me. I may not know what 
        it is yet, but chances are I’ll be able to adapt to it.

        Something I can improve on in my opinion is my writing, I cannot write 
        very well and it has been something that holds me back a bit both in the 
        workplace and in my studies. To me, writing is transferring your thoughts 
        into combinations of words into sentences into paragraphs. This is the 
        skill I lack, the ability to accurately transform my thoughts into words. 
        Perhaps it is the repetition I lack. If I keep doing it maybe eventually 
        I will get better at it. Once I have strengthened my confidence in literacy, 
        I will help me majorly on my path to becoming a successful programmer/ 
        web developer. Not only will I be more confident to write and share my idea 
        but I will be able to do it with more accuracy and efficiency. I grew up in 
        the hardship of Thailand poverty but my parents took the leap of faith and 
        got us into NZ. Considering my Thai background it is understandable that I 
        have a very stubborn mentality that will get me to the finish line. Because 
        where I came from, that could be the difference between you and your family 
        eating dinner that night or not.

       <p class="tab">
        When it comes to teamwork and the resistance and frictions that comes 
        with it, I am no stranger to the idea. I have been in a student 
        leadership role where we had to divide the work into two for both the 
        student body leaders. This helps with the overall progress of how fast 
        things get done but believe me it does not come without difficulties. 
        First you have to divide the workloads into two by abilities and 
        proficiencies with different tasks. This in it’s own present a challenge, 
        first of all you want to be fair with the workloads but different tasks 
        have different workloads. Back then, I would usually just dive in and talk 
        between ourselves and come up with a solution but now that I have learned 
        a little bit more about planning and problem solving. I would now 
        definitely sit down with my team and sit down and allocate things that 
        my teams are more comfortable with, to improve the quality and 
        timeliness of the outcome.
