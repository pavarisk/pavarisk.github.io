      <p> To capture who I am as a person, I would have to start off with Buddhism. Buddhism is my religion and a little bit about Buddhism if you have never heard of it before,
       I personally don’t like to call it a religion, because to me Buddhism is teaching a way of life. Its sole focus is on understanding yet letting go. When I am saying letting go,
       I am talking about letting go of everything and anything unexpected that may come up. It is mind training to deal with life and to live life a certain way because it changes
       your perspective on a lot of things when you’ve understood that we’re here living on borrowed time,
       to make matters worse we don’t even know how long we have exactly.

       You wouldn’t know who I really am, if you don’t know what is important to me. My family has got to be it for me, there is nothing I treasure more than my family.
       They’re a place to anchor up when I need some time away from the world, they’re the best advisor I could ask for, they’re also so much more than what i have mentioned.
       For now, I just want to say I’m glad to have them by my side every step of the way.
