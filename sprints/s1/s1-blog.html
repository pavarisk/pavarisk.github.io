      <p> To capture who I am as a person, I would have to start off with Buddhism. Buddhism is my religion and a little bit about Buddhism if you have never heard of it before,
        it is a teaching about peace and how to achieve it then apply it to everyday in your daily lives. I personally don’t like to call it a religion, because to me Buddhism
        is teaching a way of life rather than a belief system which has to deal with god. You see, there is no god in Buddhism. Buddha wasn’t the one to create the circle of 
        life, he was merely living through it and trying to understand it himself. The difference between Buddha and all Buddhist is the mere fact that he is our teacher that 
        has found a solution while working at it hands on and that we are his students, trying to follow his footstep on the path to peace and to detach yourself from the circle
        of life. The teaching’s sole focus is on understanding the matter and yet letting it go. When I am saying letting go, I am talking about letting go of everything and
        anything unexpected that may come up. Or letting go of anything undesirable that has been on your mind. If you think of a person’s brain as a computer, the more the 
        person has on their mind (almost like running multiple tabs and tasks on your computer) this will limit that person’s capability to process information and the mental 
        capacity (computing power). So if you can let go (closing tabs after you’ve processed it) it will help you become the best version of yourself. It is mind training meant 
        to deal with life and help you cope with uncertainties in life. Part of Buddhism is accepting death as a normal part of life. The way I see it is you have to understand 
        that we’re here on borrowed time, we don’t know how long we have exactly before that borrowed time runs dry.

       I am a firm believer that to know who a person really is you have to know what is important to them. For me my number one priority is my family.
       My family will always come first because they are the one that have seen me at the lowest and yet will still support me on my decisions especially if those decisions 
       will lead to a better version of me. I know that there are people out there who care for me and wish the best for me that aren’t technically my blood relatives(family) 
       but I consider those as my own and treat them like family. Because I think it is very difficult nowadays to meet people that are genuine to you and genuinely want the 
       best for you, so I will cherish those that I have found and will hold them close to my heart, as I would with family. To give an example: A few years ago, I was living 
       in Blenheim, working as an Inventory controller for a wine bottling company. I was in a comfortable job/pay. And came along the day I was on the phone talking to my 
       parents(who were at the time living in Tokoroa) and found out that the shop that my mum ran got stolen from and that my mum was also feeling threatened and is scared 
       to go to open up and close down by herself. As soon as I found out about that, I knew that I had to be there for my mum and at least go help her out until things 
       settle down. So the following day I quit my job, and let them know the situation and that I urgently needed to go to Tokoroa. Then as soon as I could I was up in 
       Tokoroa to make sure my mum feels safe and when I had the chance I talked to some of the local policemen in Tokoroa that were customers at our shop and let them know 
       the situation, they were more than happy to help keep an eye on her when she closes late and ever since then. It is a nightly routine that a cop car would drive down 
       the street every few hours to see if she has finished up and has already gone home. As for the stolen items, they weren’t just drinks so we just had to take the L on 
       that but the good thing that came of it and the main thing is that my mum is safe and worry free.
