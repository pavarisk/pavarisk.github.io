      <h1>Best practices associated with using classes vs. ids</h1>

      <h1>What are classes and ID selector when it comes to CSS?</h1>
      <p class="tab"> 
        In CSS, you can assign and control the style of HTML component on a web 
        page using a number of selectors. ID and class are two of the mostly 
        used CSS selectors that not only help with building the layout of the 
        HTML document but they also help with styling it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s first start with how ID and class selectors are used and then we 
        will continue with their differences and when to use each of them.
      </p>

      <h1>How to use ID and class selector?</h1>

      <p class="tab">
        To use an ID selector on CSS, you simply put ‘ <b>#</b> ’ (hashtag) in front of your element ID.<br>
        To use a class selector on CSS, you would instead use a  ‘ <b>.</b> ’  (full stop/dot) in front of the element Class.<br>
        
       </p>

        <img src="../../images/ClassIDs.png" alt="class & ids">
        <img src="../../images/classid2.PNG" alt="class & ids">
        </div>  

      <h1>What are the differnces?</h1>
        <p>
          The difference between an <b>ID</b> and a <b>Class</b> is that an <b>ID</b> is 
          only used to identify <b>one single component</b> in our HTML. 
          IDs are only used when one element on the page should have 
          a particular style applied to it. However, <b>a class</b> can be 
          used to identify <b>more than one HTML component.</b>

        </p>

        <h1>When to use them?</h1>

       <p class="tab">
        One trick I would use to determine which selector to use is asking myself
        "Will I need to use this css setting for something else?" If the answer is
        yes. You will probably need a class selector rather than an ID. 
        Here are somethings you should try and remember when choosing which selector
        to use.
        <ul>
            <li>If more than one elements on the page will need the same styling, use Class.</li>
            <li>If only one element will use the styling then its best to use an ID selector</li>
            <li>Use names that defines the function of the HTML the class or id encompass, not just the appearance.<br>
                For example: "navigation bar" vs "royal blue."</li>
            <li>Try not to use classes and IDs to replicate HTML elements like h1, h2 and p.</li>
            <li>Rather than overuse classes, try to use div to improve performance.</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
