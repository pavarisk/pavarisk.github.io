      <h1>Best practices associated with using classes vs. ids</h1>

        In CSS, you can assign and control the style of HTML elements on a web 
        page using a number of selectors. ID and class are two of the mostly used 
        CSS selectors that not only help with building the layout of the HTML 
        document but they also help with styling it. They are also used for 
        controlling and manipulating the DOM elements via JavaScript but we 
        shall leave that topic to another post.

        Letâ€™s first start with how ID and class selectors are used and then we 
        will continue with their differences and when to use each of them.
      </p>
        <div id="class-id-img-box">
        <img src="../../images/ClassIDs.png" alt="class & ids">
        <img src="../../images/classid2.PNG" alt="class & ids">
        </div>  
       <p class="tab">
        The id selector is used for selecting a single HTML element with 
        a unique id attribute value. In the following example, you will see 
        a division element &lt;div&gt; with an id attribute value of header.<br>
        To use an ID selector on CSS, you simply put '#' (hashtag) in front of your 
        element ID.<br>
        To use a class selector on CSS, you would instead use a '.' (fullstop/dot)
        infront of the element Class.
       </p>

       <p class="tab">
        One trick I would use to determine which selector to use is asking myself
        "Will I need to use this css setting for something else?" If the answer is
        yes. You will probably need a class selector rather than an ID. 
        Here are somethings you should try and remember when choosing which selector
        to use.
        <ul>
            <li>If more than one elements on the page will need the same styling, use Class.</li>
            <li>If only one element will use the styling then its best to use an ID selector</li>
            <li>Use names that defines the function of the HTML the class or id encompass, not just the appearance.<br>
                For example: "navigation bar" vs "royal blue."</li>
            <li>Try not to use classes and IDs to replicate HTML elements like h1, h2 and p.</li>
            <li>Rather than overuse classes, try to use div to improve performance.</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
