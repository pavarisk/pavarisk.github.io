      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

      <h1>What is my long term goal?</h1>

      <p>
        My long term goal is to be in a job that I enjoy and have a stable 
        income.I believe that the tech industry is where I need to be to 
        realise my long term goal. For the moment, I plan to learn as much as 
        I can in the field of web development and see where that takes me. 
        Hopefully I get to learn more about my options along the way and I will 
        be able to answer this question better in four months time. 
      </p>

      <h1>A description of my strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h1>

      <p>
        I like to think that I am a relatively quick learner. I am able to 
        pick up new concepts at a decent pace, I feel that this will be helpful 
        for a career in software development. The field which will always be advancing
        into the future. Adaptability will be a very helpful attribute to have in 
        the industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am however terrible at writing and coming up with contents to put 
        on the blog is another complexity on its own. So I am hoping that 
        through this course, I do pick up some writing skills from all the 
        blogs I will be putting up.
      </p>

      <h1>What skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</h1>

      <p>
        If there is a possibility of having better communication skills I 
        would love to be able to develop those. I do not have a problem 
        talking to people in general but when I feel nervous or under pressure, 
        I have the tendency to “ramble on” after the point. Sometimes I am 
        aware of it but at that point I usually cannot stop myself from 
        “rambling on”.

      <h1>My plan to manage the workload throughout this programme:</h1>

      <h2>How will I work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators 
          and industry/community representatives</h2>

      <p>
        I will be keeping a course schedule as well as a personal schedule 
        to make sure I have dedicated time to study after log off. As for 
        working with others safely, I think mutual respect is a very important 
        aspect of any team.  With the mutual respect of peer to peer or student 
        to teacher, it makes a much better learning and team working environment.
      </p>

      <h2>
        My plan for when things are building up and starting to get to me
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        I have experienced stress from tertiary study and it can be overwhelming. 
        I have a way to deal with the mental stress itself which is meditation 
        and going for walks or doing some bag work that usually make me too tired 
        to stress. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the work building up itself, I will have to allocate more time 
        in my personal schedule to catch up. Sometimes it can almost seem like 
        there aren't enough hours in the day but I will decrease the down time 
        I spend on my phone so I can have more up time to do productive work.
      </p>

      <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
      <p>
        If I become stuck during my time studying, and cannot figure it out 
        myself. I will post my question in foundation chat in Slack or directly 
        message a facilitator to clear up my confusion or to show me how to fix 
        it. I will try and be as clear as possible when it comes to my issue or 
        what I am struggling on.
      </p>

      <h1>My expectations for the facilitating team</h1>
      <p>
        I’m not sure what problems I will be coming across yet so I cannot 
        say for a fact about what I will need from the facilitators. What I
        know is, I need a clear instruction and learning path (when to do what). 
        As far as I am concerned, if I receive clear instructions and a learning 
        path, I should be able to find my way.
