      <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>

        <p>
            Emotional intelligence has been defined, by Peter Salovey and 
            John Mayer, as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's 
            emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them 
            appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking 
            and behavior". 
        </p>

        <p>
            The ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so 
            is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions 
            of others. Imagine a world in which you could not understand when a 
            friend was feeling sad or when a co-worker was angry. Psychologists 
            refer to this ability as emotional intelligence, and some experts 
            even suggest that it can be more important than IQ in your overall 
            success in life.
        </p>

      <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
        
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence, or Emotional Quotient (EQ), is defined as 
            an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express 
            emotions. People with high EQ usually make great leaders and team 
            players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and 
            connect with the people around them. IQ, or intelligence quotient, 
            is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed 
            to assess an individual's intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals 
            with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. EQ is a better
            indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, 
            good team players, and people who best work by themselves.

      <h1>Why is it important?</h1>

       <p>
        Your work life and career can be hugely affected by your EQ. Workplaces, 
        in the main, are relational environments. They are typically a melting 
        pot of different personalities, skills, strengths, and emotions. Among 
        this is the purpose of the business.
       </p>

       <p>
        Therefore, EQ is intricately melded into each and every decision and 
        action within the workplace. It’s there in the basic instruction to your 
        team, just as much as it’s present in mass organisational change. 
        Therefore, those with higher EQ typically successfully navigate the 
        workplace more effectively. EQ enables an individual to build and 
        drive successful teams and to be agile and responsive as needed. They, 
        therefore, are successful.
       </p>

       <p>
        Similarly, a lower level of EQ can be detrimental to the workplace. 
        At its worst, it can be seen in bullying, harassment, and demotivated 
        staff. It can present as insensitivity, arrogance, or even aggression 
        and volatility. Whereas a high EQ will facilitate flexibility, low EQ 
        will typically present as inflexibility and rigidity – a dangerous 
        tack for any business.
