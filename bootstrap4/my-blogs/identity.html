                <p>
                    To capture who I am as a person, I would have to start off 
                with my religion, Buddhism. For those who are unfamiliar with Buddhism, 
                it is a teaching about peace, how to achieve it and then how to apply 
                it to your everyday life. I personally don’t like to call it a religion, 
                because to me, Buddhism is teaching a way of life rather than a belief 
                system which revolves around a god. You see, there is no god in Buddhism. 
                Buddha wasn’t the one to create the circle of life, he was merely living 
                through it and trying to understand it himself. The difference between 
                Buddha and all Buddhists is the mere fact that he is our teacher. 
                By working at it hands on, he has found a solution and we are his students, 
                trying to follow in his footsteps on the path to peace as well as to 
                detach ourselves from the circle of life. The sole focus of his teachings 
                is on understanding the matter and yet, letting it go. When I am saying 
                letting go, I am talking about letting go of everything and anything 
                unexpected that may come up. Letting go of anything undesirable that 
                has been on your mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you think of a person’s brain as a computer, the more the person 
                has on their mind (almost like running multiple tabs and tasks on 
                your computer) the more this will limit that person’s capability to 
                process information and their mental capacity (computing power). 
                So if you can let go (closing tabs after you’ve processed it) it 
                will help you become the best version of yourself. Buddhism is 
                mind training meant to deal with life and help you cope with 
                uncertainties in life. Part of Buddhism is accepting death as 
                a normal part of life. The way I see it is you have to understand 
                that we’re here on borrowed time, we don’t know how long we have 
                exactly before that borrowed time runs dry.

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">What is important to me?</p>

                <p>
                    I am a firm believer that to know who a person really is you have to 
                know what is important to them. For me my number one priority is my 
                family. My family will always come first because they are the one 
                that have seen me at the lowest and yet will still support me with 
                my decisions, especially if those decisions will lead to a better 
                version of me. I know that there are people out there who care for 
                me and wish the best for me that aren’t technically my blood relatives 
                (family) but I consider those as my own and treat them like family. 
                I think it is very difficult nowadays to meet people that are genuine 
                with you and genuinely want the best for you. This is why I cherish 
                those that I have found and will hold them close to my heart, as I 
                would with family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To give an example: A few years ago, I was living in Blenheim, 
                working as an Inventory controller for a wine bottling company. 
                I was in a comfortable job/pay. Then one day I was on the phone 
                talking to my parents (who were at the time living in Tokoroa) and 
                found out that the shop that my mum ran got stolen. My mum was 
                feeling threatened and was scared to go open and close the store on 
                her own. As soon as I found out I knew that I had to be there for my 
                mum and at least go help her out until things settled down. So the 
                following day I quit my job, let them know the situation and that I 
                urgently needed to go to Tokoroa. Then as soon as I could I was up 
                in Tokoroa to make sure my mum felt safe. When I had the chance I 
                talked to some of the local policemen in Tokoroa that were customers 
                at our shop and let them know the situation, they were more than happy 
                to help keep an eye on her when she has to close late. Ever since then, 
                It is a nightly routine that a cop car would drive down the street 
                every few hours to see if she has finished up and has already gone 
                home. As for the stolen items, they weren’t just drinks so we just had 
                to take the loss, but the good thing that came of it and the main 
                thing is that my mum is safe and worry free.

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">What is my biggest strength and weakness</p>

                <p>
                    I believe my biggest strength is the ability to learn and adapt quickly. 
                I have had to adapt to changes quite a lot in my life. The idea that 
                life is ever changing was implanted within me from a very young age. 
                Through Buddhism I have learned about the impermanence and therefore I 
                accept changes, even challenging ones, with relative ease. There were 
                many things that kept changing, my schools, my uniform to even the 
                language that I considered normal for everyday use. It’s safe to say 
                that the ‘constant’ I had growing up is ‘change’. I’m thankful for what 
                happened because it improved my ability to adapt to changes from a very 
                young age and prepared myself for what was yet to be thrown at me. I 
                may not know what that is yet, but chances are I’ll be able to adapt to it.

                <p>
                    Something I can improve on in my opinion is my writing, I cannot write 
                very well and it has been something that holds me back both in the 
                workplace and in my studies. To me, writing is transferring your 
                thoughts into combinations of words which form sentences and paragraphs. 
                This is the skill I lack, the ability to accurately transform my 
                thoughts into words. Perhaps it is the repetition I lack. If I keep 
                doing it I’m certain I will eventually get better at it. Once I have 
                strengthened my confidence in literacy, it will help me majorly on my 
                path to becoming a successful programmer/ web developer. Not only will 
                I be more confident to write and share my ideas but I will be able to 
                do it with more accuracy and efficiency. I grew up in the hardship of 
                Thailand and the poverty that comes with it but my parents took the leap 
                of faith and got us into NZ. Considering my Thai background it is 
                understandable that I have a very stubborn mentality that will get me 
                to the finish line because where I came from, that mentality could be 
                the difference between you and your family having dinner that night 
                or not.

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">An example from the past.</p>

                <p>
                    When it comes to teamwork and the resistance or friction that comes 
                with it, I am no stranger to the idea. I have been in a student 
                leadership role where we had to divide the work into two for both 
                the student body leaders. This helps with the overall progress and 
                how fast things get done but believe me it does not come without 
                difficulties. First you have to divide the workload into two by 
                assessing each person’s abilities and proficiencies with different 
                tasks. This on it’s own presents a challenge, you want to be fair 
                with the workloads but different tasks have different workloads. 
                In the past, I would usually just dive in and talk between ourselves 
                to come up with a solution. Now that I have learned a little bit 
                more about planning and problem solving, I would now definitely sit 
                down with my team to allocate the tasks that my teams are more 
                comfortable with which will improve the quality and timeliness of 
                the outcome.
