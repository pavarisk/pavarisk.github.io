                    What is my long term goal?
                </p>

                <p>
                    My long term goal is to be in a job that I enjoy and have a stable 
                    income.I believe that the tech industry is where I need to be to 
                    realise my long term goal. For the moment, I plan to learn as much as 
                    I can in the field of web development and see where that takes me. 
                    Hopefully I get to learn more about my options along the way and I will 
                    be able to answer this question better in four months time. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    A description of my strengths and limitations in relation to learning
                </p>

                <p>
                    I like to think that I am a relatively quick learner. I am able to 
                    pick up new concepts at a decent pace, I feel that this will be helpful 
                    for a career in software development. The field which will always be advancing
                    into the future. Adaptability will be a very helpful attribute to have in 
                    the industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am however terrible at writing and coming up with contents to put 
                    on the blog is another complexity on its own. So I am hoping that 
                    through this course, I do pick up some writing skills from all the 
                    blogs I will be putting up.

                    What skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?

                <p>
                    If there is a possibility of having better communication skills I 
                    would love to be able to develop those. I do not have a problem 
                    talking to people in general but when I feel nervous or under pressure, 
                    I have the tendency to “ramble on” after the point. Sometimes I am 
                    aware of it but at that point I usually cannot stop myself from 
                    “rambling on”.

                    My plan to manage the workload throughout this programme:

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    How will I work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators 
                    and industry/community representatives
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will be keeping a course schedule as well as a personal schedule 
                    to make sure I have dedicated time to study after log off. As for 
                    working with others safely, I think mutual respect is a very important 
                    aspect of any team.  With the mutual respect of peer to peer or student 
                    to teacher, it makes a much better learning and team working environment.

                    My plan for when things are building up and starting to get to me
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have experienced stress from tertiary study and it can be overwhelming. 
                    I have a way to deal with the mental stress itself which is meditation 
                    and going for walks or doing some bag work that usually make me too tired 
                    to stress. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for the work building up itself, I will have to allocate more time 
                    in my personal schedule to catch up. Sometimes it can almost seem like 
                    there aren't enough hours in the day but I will decrease the down time 
                    I spend on my phone so I can have more up time to do productive work.
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I become stuck during my time studying, and cannot figure it out 
                    myself. I will post my question in foundation chat in Slack or directly 
                    message a facilitator to clear up my confusion or to show me how to fix 
                    it. I will try and be as clear as possible when it comes to my issue or 
                    what I am struggling on.
                </p>

                    My expectations for the facilitating team
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m not sure what problems I will be coming across yet so I cannot 
                    say for a fact about what I will need from the facilitators. What I
                    know is, I need a clear instruction and learning path (when to do what). 
                    As far as I am concerned, if I receive clear instructions and a learning 
                    path, I should be able to find my way.
