                    What is Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how does it influence your learning?
                </p>

                <p class="inDent">
                    Neuroplasticity refers to your brain’s ability to restructure 
                    or rewire itself when it recognizes the need for adaptation. 
                    In other words, it can continue developing and changing throughout life. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growth mindset is a term used to define individuals who believe their 
                    talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input 
                    from others). People often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible 
                    or open-minded or with having a positive outlook — qualities they believe 
                    they’ve simply always had. Everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and 
                    growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. 
                    A “pure” growth mindset doesn’t exist, which we have to acknowledge in 
                    order to attain the benefits we seek.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This means that your learning potential is not limited by age and your 
                    brain can be further developed if we work on it. If one starts using 
                    this information wisely coupled with a growth mindset. I cannot say 
                    for certain where that person's potential would end since if you do 
                    believe in yourself and keep practicing and knowing that persistence 
                    and effort is the key to success. All the while developing your 
                    neuroplasticity, could mean that you can become a better version of 
                    yourself all together.
                </p>

                    To include this newfound knowledge into my future learning there will 
                    be some changes to be made before noticeable results. Therefore I will 
                    be making a conscious effort from now on to keep developing my growth 
                    mindset and get rid of some bad habits that avoid doing something I am 
                    not good at so that I can practice and get better at it over time. 
                    Another change that I will be committing to is to not give myself a 
                    chance at all, for example, most of my life I’ve been terrible at most 
                    forms of artistry expressions like drawing, painting, playing 
                    instruments or creating music. I kept telling myself that I was not 
                    born for this and doesn’t matter how much practice goes into it I will 
                    not get any better.  From now on I will believe in myself and give 
                    myself the benefit of the doubt that maybe I can do it. When I face 
                    obstacles there will be a voice in my head that tells me that I am <b>NOT</b> 
                    failing, I just haven’t got it quite right just <b>YET</b>.
                </p>
