                What is a selector and why is it important?
            </p>

            <p>
                A Selector is a bridge between HTML elements and CSS. It allows CSS
                to manipulate the way HTML content is presented to the user on a web
                page. To understand how this works, you first need to know how a web
                page is built. Below we will look at the three components needed to
                make a functional web page: Content, Styling and Functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Content is written up on a text editor using something called
                <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b>. HTML has elements that allow
                you to create and structure the content of your website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once our web page has content and structure. Next thing to
                do is to make our web page pretty by styling it. This is when
                we would use the <b>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</b>. This is how we
                change how the content that was written in HTML is presented to
                users via browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                With just those two components, you can have a working web page
                but to make our website even more interesting and functional
                (putting the bells and whistles on). <b>JavaScript</b> is the tool that
                you need, whether you need to log what the user is doing on the
                website or to simply add some cool animations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Separately they are three different things that do their job
                very very well but not very good at doing anything else. You
                can almost think of them as a team that's working on a project
                (your web page). So for them to accurately communicate between
                each other, you need the help of a selector. In CSS, you can assign
                and control the style of HTML components on a web page using a
                number of selectors.
            </p>


            <div class="centerList d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">

                <p>
                    There are 5 main types of selectors:
                </p>

                <ul class="text-left mx-auto d-inline-block align-self-center">
                    <li>CSS Universal Selector.</li>
                    <li> Element Selector.</li>
                    <li> Id Selector.</li>
                    <li> Class Selector.</li>
                    <li>CSS Attribute Selector.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Today we will be talking about Class Selector vs ID Selector.

            <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                What are the differnces?
            </p>

            <p>
                The difference between an <b>ID</b> and a <b>Class</b> is that an <b>ID</b> is
                only used to identify <b>one single component</b> in our HTML.
                IDs are only used when one element on the page should have
                a particular style applied to it. However, <b>a class</b> can be

                What are classes and ID selector when it comes to CSS?
            </p>

            <p>
                In CSS, you can assign and control the style of HTML component on a web
                page using a number of selectors. ID and class are two of the mostly
                used CSS selectors that not only help with building the layout of the
                HTML document but they also help with styling it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s first start with how ID and class selectors are used and then we
                will continue with when to use each of them.

                How to use ID and class selector?

            <div class="centerList d-flex justify-content-center">
                <ul class="text-left mx-auto d-inline-block align-self-center">
                    <li>To use an ID selector on CSS, you simply put ‘ <b>#</b> ’ (hashtag) in front of your element ID.
                    </li>
                    <li>To use a class selector on CSS, you would instead use a ‘ <b>.</b> ’ (full stop/dot) in front of
                        the element Class.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                When to use them?
            </p>

            <p>
                One trick I would use to determine which selector to use is asking myself
                "Will I need to use this css setting for something else?" If the answer is
                yes. You will probably need a class selector rather than an ID.
                Here are somethings you should try and remember when choosing which selector
                to use.
            <div class="centerList d-flex justify-content-center">
                <ul class="text-left mx-auto d-inline-block align-self-center">
                    <li>If more than one elements on the page will need the same styling, use Class.</li>
                    <li>If only one element will use the styling then its best to use an ID selector</li>
                    <li>Use names that defines the function of the HTML the class or id encompass,<br>
                        not just the appearance. For example: "navigation bar" vs "royal blue."</li>
                    <li>Try not to use classes and IDs to replicate HTML elements like h1, h2 and p.</li>
                    <li>Rather than overuse classes, try to use div to improve performance.</li>
                </ul>
