                    What was the problem?
                </p>

                <p class="inDent">
                    I was trying to write a function that would fetch an average score of a 
                    person (Object) and was stuck on my code coming up with <em>undefined</em> so I 
                    kept changing the code until I was sure that it was what I needed. I was 
                    stuck on this one part for long enough and no amount of google search 
                    has seemed to help so I went and peaked at the solution and they had a 
                    similar function which made me sure that what I had written would work. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As it turns out after the “mouse” (rubber ducky method) and I had a chat, 
                    I found that I had misspelled one of the <b>‘average’</b>.  So after all that 
                    time trying to fix my code it was something as simple as one spell check 
                    through your code.
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    What problem solving techniques did you use?
                </p>

                <p>
                    I tried a few different techniques as the student handbook suggests and 
                    my favourite way so far is first to write out a pseudo code to remind 
                    myself the goal of this piece of code and what I want it to do when I’m 
                    done. I would also write up the steps needed for it to work in pseudo 
                    code then translate that to a functional code. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I get a block or become stuck on something, ol’ mate Google is my 
                    best friend. Usually people have had the problems before and have found 
                    a workaround or a fix to my problem. If after all that I am still stuck 
                    I would then go through my code line by line and explain what it does 
                    in layman's term to the closest object to my person. Typically it is 
                    the “mouse” in my hand.

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    How did you feel throughout the process?
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was very frustrated to start off with but the more I research and check, 
                    the more I find that there are so many ways to do one simple task. So no 
                    way is necessarily wrong if they yield the desired result. Made me feel 
                    more comfortable and happier to go through the process of actually making 
                    my code work.

                    Another example but where I did not pull my hairs out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The task was to create a function that removes odd numbers from your input 
                    and return the rest. When it comes to the operators and different loops 
                    and ways to access information, I can get a bit confused as to which one 
                    to use. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    What problem solving techniques did you use?
                </p>

                <p>
                    I did what I usually do, but this time because I have looked up different 
                    ways to do certain things so many times I get to see some different ways 
                    of writing code to do what you have in mind. Luckily when it came to 
                    knowing what to use in this scenario, I remembered that there was an 
                    operator that was perfect for what I needed to do and I went with it. 
                    After I have confirmed that the main part of the function is actually 
                    working, it was only a general tidy up that I had to do and that was 
                    that. The problem was history.
                </p>

                    In conclusion what are somethings you can take away from this blog?

                        Always pay attention to the little details, this is more of a note 
                        to self for the future. When looking for the issue, start with 
                        seeing if the code format and the spelling is correct and then see 
                        if there is a problem with the code after you have the correct 
                        format and spelling.

                        Through this experience, I learned that the more you code and the 
                        more you learn, you will recognize what to do and steps needed to 
                        successfully write a functional code to perform the required task.
