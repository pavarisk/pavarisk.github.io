                    Three new things I've learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning.

                    <li>
                        I know that I have not been the best student for the majority of my life
                        and I was not really too sure why. At the same time I also know that 
                        I could be better in some areas but I didn’t quite know how to start 
                        becoming better in terms of learning. The core learning in this 
                        programme has helped me understand myself better and to look at myself 
                        with less judgement and more understanding. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I’ve always thought being open-minded was the same as something like a 
                        growth mindset where if you keep an open mind, because it is far easier 
                        to understand something when you do not have any preconceived opinion. 
                        While there are similarities between them, those two mindsets are rather 
                        different when you actually look deeper to what a growth mindset actually 
                        is. Growth mindset is an attitude one has towards learning, where one 
                        believes that through hard work and perseverance, it is possible to 
                        keep developing your skills and talents are just a starting point to 
                        build from.

                        Lastly, I’ve found that I have known a lot of these contents have been 
                        familiar to me for a long time but I have not properly utilised them. 
                        For instance, perseverance has been something like a repeated lesson 
                        throughout my life. I have known it, seen it, used it myself but not 
                        nearly quite enough. I have given up on things in the past due to not 
                        being good at it but when I am looking back now, did I try everything 
                        I could have to get better? The simple answer is “No.” and the more 
                        complicated ones sounded a lot like excuses. Now that I understand 
                        myself better I can make the most of it and become a better version of 
                        myself.

                    Personal Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in learning and programming.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Personal Values, Empathy and Self Awareness are some qualities that 
                    relate to one’s Emotional Quotient (EQ) which play a massive role in 
                    their learning journey and workplace environment. Throughout foundation, 
                    there were many things I discovered about myself and my learning style. 
                    Self awareness is a very important one in my learning journey because I 
                    incorporate Growth Mindset into it and when I am looking back at myself, 
                    I see my current self as a work in progress and unbiasedly evaluate how 
                    I can improve myself as a person. To do this you must have your personal 
                    values in the right place because if you don’t value learning and see it 
                    as a waste of time, you are not going to learn since it is going to be 
                    much harder to do something when you do not want to. It is important 
                    that you have a reason to learn and to drive you to keep learning when 
                    things get hard.

                    Surprises throughout core learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was surprised by the topics that were introduced to us throughout 
                    foundation core learning. They were all really useful to help guide us 
                    through this learning journey. The more that I practice the better I am 
                    getting, it is an amazing feeling to feel like I am progressing which 
                    this course did beautifully. Especially if I keep up with my self 
                    awareness, I can see more clearly where I have improved and which area 
                    still needs improvement.

                    The most challenging aspect of core learning so far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Utilising what we have learned in our everyday life is rather difficult. 
                    Sometimes things that I learned just get put in an imaginary box in my 
                    mind forgotten about and not get utilised. Which I now realise is a huge 
                    waste, so in effort to keep learning and to be more efficient with it, I 
                    have given learning a mindful priority so that it is constantly something 
                    I think about and practice to sharpen my skills. Not in a specific area 
                    but as a skillset to be able to learn.
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    The awesome result of the core learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While the technical skills that you need and will be learning here is 
                    very important for your future jobs there is something very important 
                    that the core learning is teaching me, it is the ability to learn and 
                    how to learn effectively. With that skill set, I am not only limited to 
                    the technical skills that I have learned from the EDA but I will have 
                    the ability to learn more technical skills because I will know the “how”.
                </p>

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?<br>
                    Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    No way, as I have explained above. I really enjoy the core content as it 
                    teaches me to be more effective with my technical learning. If I used 
                    that time to practise programming instead it is very likely that I would 
                    have encountered a problem and get disheartened from it, if i didn’t 
                    have the problem solving skills or the mindset to keep going it is very 
                    likely that programming would have been a short lived interest I had for 
                    a while since it got too hard and I did not know what to do with it and 
                    quit. Now I have the knowledge to keep a positive mindset going and to 
                    understand that I did not fail, I haven’t succeeded <b>YET</b>
