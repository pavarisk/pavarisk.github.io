                    Lets briefly discuss the differences between HTML and CSS
                </p>

                <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the structure and the content 
                    of the website, it is plain but very effective at what it is meant to 
                    do. All the while the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) changes the way that 
                    the structure and the content is presented to the user.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These two can be thought of as a house. HTML creates the structure of 
                    the house(The walls, floor and roof) and puts content (Furnitures) into 
                    the house. While CSS will paint the house, carpet the floor and rearrange 
                    the furniture to make the house look nice. 
                </p>

                    JavaScript control flow and loops
                </p>

                <p>
                    The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in your script. 
                    This means that the control flow is the order that our computer uses 
                    to decide on which part of your code to run next. Most of the time 
                    our codes will run from top to bottom, but sometimes we need it to 
                    do something differently so that we don’t run into any problems. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A loop is one way of controlling the flow of how your code would run. 
                    It is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated for a 
                    specified amount of time or until a certain condition is met in 
                    computer programming. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    So if I was to take control flow out of a coding concept and apply it 
                    to our everyday life it can almost be thought of as your daily 
                    schedule. If you have a list of things you have to get to that day, 
                    typically the list will be written in order of things to do but we 
                    do not necessarily have to go about it from top to bottom. Sometimes 
                    it is important that something gets done a few times or until a 
                    certain condition is met. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, you may need the repetition to do something like going 
                    to the gym and repeatedly lifting weight for the result that you 
                    will get stronger. Another example, you may need to look for a pair 
                    of shoes which will require you to go into the shop and look around 
                    at different shoes until you find the one that you want. Both of 
                    these examples are to simplify loops in a non technical manner.

                    What is the DOM? How would you interact with it?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Documents Object Model or the DOM is a representation of your 
                    entire website starting from as far back as the window and breaking 
                    the components down to every little single element. This gives us a 
                    way to pinpoint access our elements using JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Easiest way to choose the element you would like to interact with is to use document.getElementById(“id”).

                    What are functions and why are they useful to us?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Functions in JavaScript are typically a block of code written to 
                    perform a specific task. The function will run when  “something” 
                    calls on it.<br>
                    It can be used to do many things and one of them is to make your
                    website more slightly more exciting.

                    Differences between Arrays and Objects?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arrays are lists of data you want to store, similar to grocery lists. 
                    Objects are slightly different, they are “things” with 
                    characteristics or properties more like a car or a house or even 
                    something like personal contact information. 
                </p>

                <img src="../../images/arrays-objects.png" class="img-fluid rounded p-5 mx-auto d-block" alt="Arrays and Objects">

                <p>
                    To access the information from either an array or object, there 
                    is a slight difference as to how you would access the data you 
                    require. For example, you may want to present the whole list(array) 
                    or just some items from the list. This can be done by just calling 
                    the array or specifying the items from the array. In programming, 
                    the start of the count is not on 1 but 0. So when you are choosing 
                    which item you want from the array start your count from 0. 
                    Similarly you can call on the whole object or call on specific 
                    property of the object.
