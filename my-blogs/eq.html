                    What is Emotional Intelligence?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence has been defined, by Peter Salovey and 
                    John Mayer, as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's 
                    emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them 
                    appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking 
                    and behavior". 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so 
                    is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions 
                    of others. Imagine a world in which you could not understand when a 
                    friend was feeling sad or when a co-worker was angry. Psychologists 
                    refer to this ability as emotional intelligence, and some experts 
                    even suggest that it can be more important than IQ in your overall 
                    success in life.

                <p class="lead p-3 text-center">
                    How is it different to IQ?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emotional Intelligence, or Emotional Quotient (EQ), is defined as 
                    an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express 
                    emotions. People with high EQ usually make great leaders and team 
                    players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and 
                    connect with the people around them. IQ, or intelligence quotient, 
                    is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed 
                    to assess an individual's intelligence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals 
                    with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. EQ is a better
                    indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, 
                    good team players, and people who best work by themselves.

                    Why is it important?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your work life and career can be hugely affected by your EQ. Workplaces, 
                    in the main, are relational environments. They are typically a melting 
                    pot of different personalities, skills, strengths, and emotions. Among 
                    this is the purpose of the business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, EQ is intricately melded into each and every decision and 
                    action within the workplace. It’s there in the basic instruction to your 
                    team, just as much as it’s present in mass organisational change. 
                    Therefore, those with higher EQ typically successfully navigate the 
                    workplace more effectively. EQ enables an individual to build and 
                    drive successful teams and to be agile and responsive as needed. They, 
                    therefore, are successful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, a lower level of EQ can be detrimental to the workplace. 
                    At its worst, it can be seen in bullying, harassment, and demotivated 
                    staff. It can present as insensitivity, arrogance, or even aggression 
                    and volatility. Whereas a high EQ will facilitate flexibility, low EQ 
                    will typically present as inflexibility and rigidity – a dangerous 
                    tack for any business.
